# Contributing Guide for Students

## Getting Started Early

Experience shows that the best thing to help your application is to engage with the
organization you want to work with early. For Deep Fusion AI you should introduce yourself in the [WhatsApp workspace](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IrVPYeWtS0p8uEpvomBZFH). [The opensource guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) has a
good introduction how to start contributing to open source projects.

## Am I experienced enough?

The answer is generally: **Yes**. We value creativity, intelligence and
enthusiasm above specific knowledge of the libraries or algorithms we use. We
think that an interested and motivated student who is willing to learn is more
valuable than anything else. The range of available projects should suit people
with different backgrounds. At the same time, if you have experience using your
project of choice or one of its dependencies (e.g. language) make sure to let
us know about that as well.
[The "Am I Good Enough" FLOSS manual](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/am-i-good-enough/)
gives a good overview of this part for WoC.

## Our Expectations From Students

### During the application phase

*The tips listed here can help your application. They are not required*

Organizations usually favor students that show a regular communication with
possible mentors and organizations until we announce the accepted projects.

Establishing a regular communication is good for 2 reasons. It shows that you are a reliable student and that you have good communication skills. Good communication skills are an important part of WoC since a student and mentor can rarely meet in person. Please, communicate through the WhatsApp channel, or on github. Please, do not send private messages to mentors and organizers; if you have a question, it is highly probable another person has the same question, and they can benefit from the open discussion.

You can get started by exploring the references in the project descriptions, getting familiar with the Deep Fusion AI repositories and data, attempting some of the suggested steps and trying out listed tools, reading through the wiki and contributing missing details, resolving issues, reviewing PRs, improving code documentation and style, and adding tests.  Before submitting a big code change, make sure you open an issue to discuss with other contributors. 

When we evaluate an application we use the following point system to get a baseline comparison of students. We are providing this rubric to help you successfully apply and not miss any key components of the application process. You don't have to tick off all of these, and you can always do more, but these are our basic expecations. We will be fair, we promise, but will rate your effort from 1-5 (1 is failure to complete; 3 is completion, but with average effort; 5 is full completion with effort in the top 10% of your peers).

- 5pts Communicate with organization's mentors
- 5pts Communicate with the community
- 5pts Follow instructions and format of the [Deep Fusion AI WoC proposal template](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/blob/master/STUDENT-proposal-template.md)
- 5pts Properly cite the work of others in your proposal and code, including links to repos or provided code
- 5pts Provide all requested contact information (i.e. email & slack name, & github if available)
- 5pts Project title, abstract, and detailed description
- 5pts Include all requested technical details (see template)
- 5pts Include a preliminary project schedule in your proposal (ideally addressing how you will spend your time before, during, after WoC)
- 5pts Evidence that you have time for WoC. This is an unpaid job with an expectation of 30-40 hrs/week! State how many hours per week you plan to work in your proposal and list other time commitments.
- 5pts Document your development and other experience relevant to the project(s)
- 5pts Explain why you are interested in the project and are a good fit
- 5pts Submit a pull request to the existing code, or discover and/or discuss issues with the current code.
- 5pts Continue communication through date upon which accepted students are determined.
- 0pts Be honest! Only universal Karma points. ðŸ™‚ We are happy to see you grow in your learning process, but we also need to understand your technical skills and make sure that we have mentors that can support you in the process. Also, if we discover you were dishonest in your application, we will fail you and move on to collaborating with others.

### During the winter

*The items here are a requirement for students during the winter*

**Communication**

- Write a short report for us every two weeks in the WhatsApp group, discuss it with your mentor(s), and be sure to include personal goals for the next 2-week period.
- Commit early and commit often! Push to a public repository (e.g. github) so
  that we can see and review your work.
- Actively work on our project timeline and communicate with us during the
  community bonding period.
- Communicate every working day with your mentor. Preferably in public using the
  standard channels of your project.
- If there is a reason why you can't work or can't contact us on a regular basis,
  please make us aware of this.
- If you don't communicate with us regularly we will fail you.

**Evaluations**

- Set a realistic goal for all evaluation deadlines. If you fail to meet your own goal, we are more likely to fail you in the evaluations.
- Communicate ASAP with the project mentor if evaluation metrics are unclear.

## Proposal Instructions

Projects proposed by mentors are listed at our [IDEA.md](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/blob/master/IDEA.md).

Please title your proposal appropriately. You are free to use components from several projects ideas. Be realistic about the scope. You are also welcome to propose your own idea, but first discuss it on WhatsApp to ensure there will be mentors who can support it.

### How to write a great Proposal

First, think about your choice of project carefully. You're going to be doing it for a months, so it's important that you choose something you're going to enjoy. 

Once you've made your mind up:

1. Make sure you've thought about the project and understand what it entails.
2. Engage with the community early. The earlier you contact us, the more feedback you will receive on your application. It may take time to review the draft proposals so feel free to ask on WhatsApp or GitHub whether your proposed path makes sense. Also open-source code is often built in the open, so it is usual to obtain feedback within public fora.
3. Don't be afraid to come up with original solutions to the problem.
4. Don't hesistate to give us lots of detail about how you would approach the project, but also be succinct and convey your ideas clearly. A picture or a link may be worth a lot of words.

Overall, your application should make us believe that you are capable of completing the project and delivering the functionality to our Deep Fusion AI users and/or the broader open-source community. If you aren't sure about something, ask questions on WhatsApp where we're happy to advise you.

### How to estimate time needed for development
Get some familiarity with the Deep Fusion AI repositories and data. Test existing functions, add missing details, fix code style. Do some research on the methods and tools you plan to use. Install the needed packages and build a plan of how they will work together. Write down your algorithms in pseudo code. 

The better your research is and the better you plan ahead, the easier it will be to judge how long a given task will take. For
your time estimates you should also consider that you can do less during exams or other summer activities, so try to be a bit conservative. Discuss the risks of the proposal and potential challenges. How do you intend to address them? What criteria will you use to evaluate milestones (code tests, functional demo, baseline recording, etc.)? If you have never done anything like WoC before, you will tend to underestimate the time to complete a task. We know that making accurate estimates isn't easy, but having a good plan -- including identifying its weak and strong points -- will help ensure a successful summer of coding.

### Final Proposal

Your final proposal must be submitted to us as a PDF file, using [this template](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/blob/master/STUDENT-proposal-template.md). Your proposal should be named appropriately to make identification easier for the mentors. To convert a draft that you have written
before into PDF you can use [iLovePDF](https://www.ilovepdf.com/).
