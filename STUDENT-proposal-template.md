* Resources Review
* Preliminary Attempts
Provide links whenever possible.

## Schedule of Deliverables

Here you should provide a list of your milestones. Below are a series of suggested sub-sections based on the
different phases of WoC. You can use it as a template, but you can/should add more details
for each phase, e.g. by breaking it down into weeks or setting specific targets for each
phase. Each target should be split into sub-tasks with time estimates. [Work
breakdown structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) may be helpful here.

### **Community Bonding Period**

This phase is to get to know the community better. Check that your build environment is setup. This time should also be used to discuss your project in more detail with the community, including introducing yourself and beginning to vet your ideas.

### **Final Week**

At this stage you should finish up your project and ensure that you have code submitted to your organization. Our main criteria to define your project as a success is submission of code advancements before the end of GSoC.
