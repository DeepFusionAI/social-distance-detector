# Winter of Code 2020

## Winter of Code (WoC) projects and products related to [Deep Fusion AI](https://deepfusionai.github.io/)!

Deep Fusion AI is a mentoring organization for [Winter of Code 2020](https://winterofcode.com/). AI can help, but it’s not a silver bullet: tackling societal challenges requires a concerted, collaborative effort across all sectors of society. At Deep Fusion AI, we’re conducting research that advances the state-of-the-art in the field, applying Deep Learning to products and to new domains, and developing tools to ensure that everyone can access AI.

Deep Fusion AI aims to recruit talented WoC students to help us advance the field of Artificial Intelligence with open-source software (and hardware). All code contributed by WoC students will be shared under open-source licenses and any data products derived from Deep Fusion AI data will be shared under [Deep Fusion AI's Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

In the IDEA.md file of this repository, we list project ideas from mentors. Deep Fusion AI also encourages you -- as a WoC student -- to propose your own original project ideas (as PRs to [IDEA.md](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/blob/master/IDEA.md)).

After you [sign up as a WoC student](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDXgvlFMAZFZ3K6rsseVPoa5pgVk-kYpaU7h6OkA4AE2SGEA/viewform?usp=sf_link) please refer to the [Deep Fusion AI Contribution Guide](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/blob/master/STUDENT-contribution-guide.md) and the [Deep Fusion AI Proposal Template](https://github.com/DeepFusionAI/social-distance-detector/blob/master/STUDENT-proposal-template.md) as you draft your proposal.
